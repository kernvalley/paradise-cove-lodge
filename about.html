<h2>About Paradise Cove Restaurant & Motel</h2>

<p>Bo & Margaret Williams bought a piece of property in Lake Isabella in the 1950's
and built a coffee shop. They broke ground on the motel in 1964 and opened Memorial
Day weekend 1966.  On April Fool's Day 1969 the cafe caught fire and burned to the ground.
In 1971 they converted the upstairs game room of the motel into a new steak house
style restaurant and built a kitchen in back.  Later they added a bar downstairs
and expanded the dining room.</p>

<p>In 1991 Bo & Margaret sold the business to their daughter, Pam.  Now their son
Wesley and his wife LeAnn and Pam's son John are also partners in the business.
Margaret still helps out as well as some of the other grandchildren, so some nights
you may see three generations of the Williams family at Paradise Cove.</p>
