<h2>Location</h2>
<p>We are located on Highway 178 on the south side of Lake Isabella, just 3 miles
east of the dam.  Only one hour from Bakersfield or Ridgecrest, and 3 hours
from Los Angeles; a perfect place for a weekend get away.​</p>
<h4>Have dinner and stay for the night.​</h4>

<p class="inline-block">Come and stay for the weekend, or longer. There is so much to do in Lake Isabella:
fishing and water sports including waterskiing or wakeboarding and jet skis,
biking and hiking the many trails in our area.</p>
<p class="inline-block">We are in a great location for an overnight stop for those traveling
to Las Vegas, Death Valley, the coast or Sequoia National Forest.</p>
