# About Us
In the 1950's Bo & Margaret Williams bought a piece of property in Lake Isabella
that had a cabin after many weekend trips with the kids they built a coffee shop
and named it Paradise Cove (before the area was called Paradise Cove).

In the mid 60's they built a 12 unit motel and made the permanent move to the valley.

On April Fool's Day 1969 the cafe caught fire and burned to the ground.  In 1971,
they converted the upstairs game room of the motel into a new steak house style
restaurant and built a kitchen in back.  Later they added a bar downstairs and
expanded the dining room.

Today you will still find family working and managing the business - with the
desire to pass along a work ethic, and the joy of simplicty and hospitality.
