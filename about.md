# About Us
In the 1950's Bo & Margaret Williams bought a piece of property in Lake Isabella
that had a cabin after many weekend trips with the kids they built a coffee shop
and named it Paradise Cove (before the area was called Paradise Cove).

In the mid 60's they built a 12 unit motel and made the permanent move to the valley.

On April Fool's Day 1969 the cafe caught fire and burned to the ground.  In 1971,
they converted the upstairs game room of the motel into a new steak house style
restaurant and built a kitchen in back.  Later they added a bar downstairs and
expanded the dining room.

Today you will still find family working and managing the business - with the
desire to pass along a work ethic, and the joy of simplicty and hospitality.

## Our Rooms
All of our rooms  share a community front porch and have great lake views.
There is a community lounge area.  The rooms have new flat screen TV's with
sattelite TV and HBO.  Coffee makers and mini-refrigerators are in every room.
New Heating & air-conditioning units and free Wi-Fi.

## Location
We are located on Highway 178 on the south side of Lake Isabella, just 3 miles
east of the dam.  Only one hour from Bakersfield or Ridgecrest, and 3 hours
from Los Angeles; a perfect place for a weekend get away.​

Come and stay for the weekend, or longer. There is so much to do in Lake Isabella:
fishing and water sports including waterskiing or wakeboarding and jet skis,
biking and hiking the many trails in our area.

We are in a great location for an overnight stop for those traveling
to Las Vegas, Death Valley, the coast or Sequoia National Forest.

Stay in one of our comfortable rooms and have dinner with great
views of the lake and mountains.
