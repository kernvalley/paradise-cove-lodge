## About Us
In the 1950's Bo & Margaret Williams bought a cabin with about 30 acres.  Here
they raised their 3 children in an atmosphere of work and hospitality.  Today
there is a simple 10 room motel and a dinner house serving  some of the best steaks
and dinners in Kern County.

1950's: After many weekend trips with the kids they built a coffee shop and named
it Paradise Cove (before the area was called Paradise Cove). And they all worked.

1960's through 2020's  Life had ups and downs, births and deaths, business had
ups and downs.  And we lived and loved and worked.


Today you will still find family working - with the desire to pass along a work
ethic, and the joy of simplicity and hospitality.

### Our Dining Room
We consider ourselves  a traditional steakhouse.  We use local Harris Ranch Choice
Angus beef. We also have premium seafood and other dishes.   All of our dinners
are served with family style house salad with cheesebread (our recipe on Kern
County's Pyreenes Bakery's sourdough, choice of potatoe and house cheesecake.
 A full bar is available along with a decent list of wines and beers.

Dining room is available for banquets and events on Mondays and Tuesdays.

### Our Rooms
All of our rooms  share a community front porch and have great lake views. There
is a community lounge area.  The rooms have flat screen TV's with satellite
TV and HBO.  Coffee makers and mini-refrigerators are in every room. Heating
& air-conditioning units and free Wi-Fi.

Gift cards are available for purchase to use with motel or dining room.

### Location
We are located on Highway 178 on the south side of Lake Isabella, just 3 miles
east of the dam.  Only one hour from Bakersfield or Ridgecrest, and 3 hours
from Los Angeles; a perfect place for a weekend get away.​

Come and stay for the weekend, or longer. There is so much to do in Lake Isabella:
fishing and water sports including waterskiing or wakeboarding and jet skis,
biking and hiking the many trails in our area.

We are in a great location for an overnight stop for those traveling
to Las Vegas, Death Valley, the coast or Sequoia National Forest.

Stay in one of our comfortable rooms and have dinner with great
views of the lake and mountains.
